# A Little About Me

My name is Deanna Stover and I am currently working towards my BA in English Literature with a Classical Studies Certificate in Latin from Arizona State University (ASU).

I'm an English Literature major in part because I love reading, but also because it involves so much more! To really analyze a text, you need to practice critical thinking skills, know about the history of the time period in order to contextualize the text, and be able to express yourself and your ideas clearly. I really believe that studying English requires you to draw on other humanities disciplines in order to make a successful argument, and because of that, I feel better prepared to approach a myriad of topics with creativity and curiosity. 

(This is where you could put a paragraph about your interest in this course in particular. I didn't know what DH was until after I graduated undergrad!)

My ultimate goal is to work in publishing. I already have publishing experience ranging from fiction to nonfiction to journalism, helping to prepare me for variety of opportunities. I've worked as an Editor of the student-run magazine, *Marooned Undergraduate Creative Review*. In addition to working with authors, I helped with marketing and layout. I also had an amazing opportunity to study abroad in London, England. While there, I served as a marketing intern for [Reaktion Books](http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/). 

For the last year, I have worked as a Print Designer for *Emeritus Voices*, a literary journal published through the Emeritus College at ASU, so I've been able to work with several retired professors. As a print designer, I've learned a lot about the design that goes into readying publications, and I have even more practical experience working with Adobe InDesign and Illustrator now.

I've also written several articles for the Department of English at ASU as part of my other current job as the Public Relations Intern, including ["To Canterbury Town: Celebrating Chaucer at ASU."](https://asunow.asu.edu/content/canterbury-town-celebrating-chaucer-asu) Writing journalism pieces has been an important part of better understanding different genres of writing, specifically when it comes to print versus web-based venues. 

Now that I am a senior in college, I am taking graduate-level classes in scholarly editing. These courses focus on nonfiction academic works, and I've become very familiar with the Chicago style guide, although (controversially, I know) I prefer MLA.

My favorite class in college so far has to be "British Boys and their Imaginary Toys," an English course all about British children's literature. Weirdly enough, it was an online course, but the Professor really pushed me to go beyond the traditional essay format, and I appreciated learning about new ways of thinking and writing. Besides, I got to read children's literature again and realized that Victorian children's literature is my favorite thing to study--partly because it is so weird! If you don't believe me, check out [*The Water Babies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Water-Babies,_A_Fairy_Tale_for_a_Land_Baby) by Charles Kingsley. We didn't read this in class, but I discovered it on my own and it is so very, very strange.  

I spend most of my spare time with my friends at [my favorite coffee shop](https://cartelroasting.co/) (Dirty Chais forever) or baking sweets for everyone to enjoy. And we do enjoy them. Back when i was 16, I even won first place in the Arizona State Fair for my Snickerdoodles! 

Volunteering is also really important to me, and I've spent over 1000 hours working as a Peer Leader at ORHO: Workshops for Youth and Families (now [Youth Rising](https://youthrisingaz.org/)). In this role, I mentor children and young adults who are struggling with personal issues and need a safe space. It's been an enlightening experience, and I've learned a lot about how to better communicate and deal with conflict.

I have a fifteen-year-old dog named Pearl, and sometimes my mother and I wear matching shirts. If it isn't obvious by that alone, I'm an only child.

I've travelled to over twenty countries and find joy in getting to experience other cultures . . . although there was that one time I was accidentally tear gassed by the police in Ecuador when I was twelve. I'm still not entirely sure *why* the police tear gassed the crowd at the festival my parents and I were attending, but it was definitely an experience!

All this said, I wouldn't be a true English major if I didn't end by talking about my favorite book at the moment: J.M. Barrie's *Peter Pan*. I think it's the perfect book for all college seniors to read because much of it is about the inability to avoid growing up. The end of college is a bittersweet moment and a rough transition, as exciting as the opportunities after college will be. Part of me doesn't want to "grow up," but I am growing up (ready or not), and I'm looking forward to what comes next, both professionally and personally.
