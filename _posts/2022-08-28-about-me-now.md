# Dr. Stover's About Me

![Deanna Stover smiling at the camera](https://deanna-stover.github.io/deanna-stover/images/Profile.jpg)

I am an Assistant Professor of English at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/people/deannastover/) in Newport News, Virginia. I also Co-Direct the Digital Humanities minor (DH) there. My pronouns are she/her and I specialize in DH, Victorian Literature, and Children's Literature. My work often deals with the intersection of these three topics, such as in [my digital edition of H.G. Wells's *Little Wars*](https://scholarlyediting.org/2017/editions/littlewars/intro.html) (1913).

I'm currently working on expanding this project to include a critical edition of Wells's *Floor Games* (1911). Both *Floor Games* and *Little Wars* are about play with toy soldiers, so I'm rethinking how **digital** editions can invite and even necessitate **physical** engagement. As part of this, I am working with a designer to create 3D printable versions of the civilian miniatures Wells and his illustrator imagined in *Floor Games* for users to download and then print themselves.

I'm currently co-writing an article about 3D modeling the suffragette miniature from the illustration above and how it relates to H.G. Wells's suffragette fiction. This is a form of, as Jentery Sayers calls it, "prototyping the past," which involves both DH and [Critical Making]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_making). I’m especially interested in how Critical Making (or, the process of using hands-on, creative methods to explore technology in a way that involves critical thinking) can impact the ways we “read” historical artifacts, both real and imagined. 

In addition, I'm continuing to work on a digital edition of "The Yellow Wall-paper" by Charlotte Perkins Stetson, or Gilman as she is most commonly known. This open access edition, [currently available in beta](https://yellowwallpaperedition.com/), highlights the variants between the manuscript of “The Yellow Wall-paper” and the first published version, which appeared in *The New England Magazine* in January 1892. 

My students have been heavily involved in “The Yellow Wall-Paper” edition. Not only did students produce the first round of code, but I worked with a Summer Scholar to help me compile and edit that code, research Charlotte Perkins Gilman and "The Yellow Wall-paper," and help draft an introduction. This edition has now been peer reviewed by *The Recovery Hub for American Women Writers* and will appear in a September 2022 showcase. As the edition is still in beta, students in my Introduction to Digital Humanities class in Fall 2022 will continue to work on the edition. It will truly be an edition *by* students *for* students.

But back to games. They're not only central to my scholarship, but also to my personal life. In my spare time, I play Dungeons & Dragons and other Tabletop Role-Playing Games, or TTRPGs. I actually met my husband playing D&D, which, to be perfectly honest, I thought was a board game when I first got asked to play. My last long-term TTRPG game was a year-long campaign of [Curse of Strahd](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/curse-strahd), a game about vampires--another interest of mine.

I have two wonderful cats who like to interrupt my games and work. Yes, I am *that* cat lady.

I graduated with my PhD in English Literature and graduate certificates in Digital Humanities and Women's and Gender Studies from Texas A&M University in August 2020. My BA is from Arizona State University, where I majored in English Literature with a Classical Certificate in Latin. I am also a member of [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/), a prestigious academic society, and one of my little-known passions is working with students in prison. I've taught in two prisons, and I hope to do more of this work going forward.
