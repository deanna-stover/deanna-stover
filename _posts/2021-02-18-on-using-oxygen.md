# On Using Oxygen: My First Experience with Coding in XML

For this assignment, I was given the second column of page 649 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s short horror story, “The Yellow Wallpaper.” With this section, I was tasked with coding the text as it appeared using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in Oxygen, a coding program that uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML). As a part of our assignment, I mimicked markup in a Google Doc with the elements that I would need to put in tags once working in Oxygen in order to introduce us to all the things we would have to do for our assignment and to ease us into the coding process.

## Markup in Google Docs

After being assigned our individual sections, we each had accesss to a Google Doc with our text copied into it. There, we marked things like where paragraphs started, any quotations, italics, em-dashes, and even images. I was really thankful to only have paragraph markers, dialogue, and one instance where a word was italicised in my reading, so I wasn’t overly confused about what I needed to be marking in this section of the project.

Further, by going through and marking each thing that I would be coding later, it really helped to break down what I needed to do once I started working in Oxygen. Looking at my Doc, I felt a lot less overwhelmed, and the coding aspect seemed a lot less daunting.

## Using Oxygen and XML

While marking the Google Doc helped to ease a lot of fears about this project, once I had to download Oxygen, that fear returned. I’m not super tech-savvy. My parents are both computer analysts, but it seems like that tech gene skipped a generation. Opening Oxygen and the TEI file for the first time was super overwhelming—the file opened up, and suddenly I was faced with all of these lines of code and I had no idea what they meant.

Further, when I work in Word, Docs, and other word processors, I find a lot of comfort in knowing what each of the functions are and where to find everything. Even though my professor was teaching us how to use Oxygen, it was still a huge learning curve as I clicked around, trying to get the hang of the program. Thankfully, by the end of the class period, I started to feel more comfortable with using the program, but it also helped that our professor gave us time during the following class period to work on coding so that we could ask her questions.

Another aspect of using Oxygen is the XML tags. While this was new to a lot of students, I actually had some experience with HTML, which is similar in its tagging process. I write for Her Campus, and back when I first joined, we actually had to use HTML to code pictures we wanted to use into our articles. Further, as a general requirement of CNU, I also took a very introductory computer science class, where we went much more in-depth into different HTML tags, what they do, and how to use them.

This background experience was super helpful in coding in Oxygen, even though I had never used a coding program before. Still, I knew about the logistics of tagging, like to always remember to have the closing tag and to include all of my text within the body tag. However, this experience only helped me understand what I was doing. There were tags that I had to use that I had never used before, like the quotation and italics tags, so I was still alert as I was typing everything out to make sure that I was doing everything correctly.

Despite my struggles with the various moving parts of this project, I am really enjoying it. I feel like working in Oxygen with TEI has given me a lot of experience that I might be able to apply to a future career down the road. I am definitely still learning, but I feel a lot more comfortable with coding now than I did going in. Hopefully, we will have more opportunities to work in Oxygen and learn more about it!
