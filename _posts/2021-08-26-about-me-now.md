# Dr. Stover's About Me

![Deanna Stover smiling at the camera](https://deanna-stover.github.io/deanna-stover/images/Profile.jpg)

I am an Assistant Professor of English at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/people/deannastover/) in Newport News, Virginia. I also Co-Direct the Digital Humanities minor (DH) there. My pronouns are she/her and I specialize in DH, Victorian Literature, and Children's Literature. My work often deals with the intersection of these three topics, such as in [my digital edition of H.G. Wells's *Little Wars*](https://scholarlyediting.org/2017/editions/littlewars/intro.html) (1913).

I'm currently working on expanding this project to include a critical edition of Wells's *Floor Games* (1911). Both *Floor Games* and *Little Wars* are about play with toy soldiers, so I'm rethinking how **digital** editions can invite and even necessitate **physical** engagement. As part of this, I am working with a designer to create 3D printable versions of the civilian miniatures Wells and his illustrator imagined in *Floor Games* for users to download and then print themselves.

I'm currently co-writing an article about 3D modeling the suffragette miniature from the illustration above and how it relates to H.G. Wells's suffragette fiction. This is a form of, as Jentery Sayers calls it, "prototyping the past," which involves both DH and Critical Making. My co-author is also coming up with instructions for how to paint the 3D-printed miniature according to early-twentieth century fashions. Since the suffragette miniature Wells and the illustrator, J.R. Sinclair, imagined carries a "Votes for Women" sign while selling papers, she is clearly a part of the Women's Social and Political Union, the most militant organization fighting for suffrage in the UK. Because of this, she will be painted in the WSPU's colors of white, purple, and green. 

In addition, I'm creating a digital edition of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wall-paper." This edition, which will compare the manuscript and periodical versions of Gilman's work, will heavily involve students. Students have worked on the first round of coding, and I worked with a Summer Scholar to help me compile and edit that code, research Charlotte Perkins Gilman and "The Yellow Wall-paper," and help draft an introduction. It will truly be an edition *by* students *for* students.

But back to games. They're not only central to my scholarship, but also to my personal life. In my spare time, I play Dungeons & Dragons and other Table-Top Role Playing Games, or TTRPGs. I actually met my husband playing D&D, which, to be perfectly honest, I thought was a board game when I first got asked to play. Many years later, we're finishing up a year-long campaign of [Curse of Strahd](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/curse-strahd), a game about vampires--another major interest of mine.

I have two wonderful cats who like to interrupt my games and work. Yes, I am *that* cat lady.

I graduated with my PhD in English Literature and graduate certificates in Digital Humanities and Women's and Gender Studies from Texas A&M University in August 2020. My BA is from Arizona State University, where I majored in English Literature with a Classical Certificate in Latin. I am also a member of [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/) and one of my little-known passions is working with students in prison. I've been lucky enough to teach in two prisons and I hope to do more of this work going forward.
