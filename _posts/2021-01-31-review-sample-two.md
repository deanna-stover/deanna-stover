*A Digital Anthology of Early Modern English Drama* (EMED) is a digital humanities project centered around performance and plays from 16th and 17th century England. Created under project director Kathleen Lynch of the Folger Shakespeare Library, it is comprised of 403 surviving performed texts from 1576 to 1642. These works are not Shakespeare’s but rather those from other playwrights of the time. Through tools such as Folger Digital Texts API, Open Refine, GeoNames, and more, the texts themselves and a large assortment of resources have been brought together with the goal of presenting early modern English performance to a wide variety of audiences.

All 403 plays are available in multiple formats: in-browser, PDF, HTML, and XML. The in-browser option also allows for seamless switching between original and regularized spellings, depending on the needs of the reader. Fully scanned facsimiles are also available for certain texts through the Folger Shakespeare Library’s main collection. The red icons for accessing each file format are distinctive, though the title and author links are hard to recognize as clickable. An additional note at the top to explain this or a more distinguishable font color could help immensely.

Each text has a detailed page with extra information about the text and the artifact itself. This includes features such as previous versions of the transcription, information about the physical text and its condition, a bibliography, and more. While not necessarily useful for the average reader, it does provide an invaluable wealth of information for scholars.

The formatting of the texts themselves are somewhat challenging to read. Both the in-browser and PDF versions have very condensed text with little spaces or gaps between lines. If they were to have more distinct spaces between individual lines, especially between different characters speaking, the texts would be much easier to both skim and read thoroughly. There are occasional formatting issues throughout, as certain lines will run off the page into the background, though they only seem to occur a few times per play at most.

The project as a whole is supported by both a user guide and a FAQ, which are both easily found within the website. The are catered toward multiple levels of experience, ranging from complete novices to scholars. This, combined with the well-crafted layouts of the site, make navigation quite simple overall.

The “Featured Plays” link in the header does wonders for keeping the site accessible for the average viewer. With over 400 plays and multiple file formats, it would be easy to get overwhelmed, so this option provides a convenient starting point. However, finding the complete list of texts is convoluted, so an “All Plays” button in the header as well would be very useful. A feature such as that would benefit both new audiences (to make searching less discouraging) and scholars (who may need to find more obscure plays quickly).

EMED is not just a collection of texts but also includes resources about early modern English drama. Resources about editing, performance, and teaching are also all readily available. These sections are well-laid out into informative, clearly-labeled sections with many helpful images. Many other links are included as citations and to provide quick, easy access to more information.

Overall, this project is very well-designed and caters a wide variety of uses and experience levels. While there are changes that could be made in the future to improve ease of access, EMED is solidly founded around the idea of making a lesser-known topic more available to a variety of audiences — and it follows through with that goal.
